 * 
 *  - cb set to the callback function pointer
 *  - user_ptr set to point to application state; this is not touched
 *  by onload
 *  - msg.msghdr.msg_control set to an appropriate buffer (if required)
 *  - msg.msghdr.msg_controllen let to length of msg_control
 *  - msg.msghdr.msg_name & msg_namelen set as you would for recvmsg
 *  - flags set to indicate behavior (e.g. ONLOAD_MSG_DONTWAIT)
 *
 * Onload makes only limited checks for validity on the arguments
 * passed in, so care should be taken to ensure they are correct.
 * Cases such as NULL args pointer, etc. may result in incorrect
 * application behaviour.
 *
 * The supplied onload_zc_recv_args structure is passed through to
 * the callback every time the callback is called.
 *
 * Before calling the callback onload will fill in the args.msg.iov
 * with details of the received data, and args.msg.msghdr with the
 * relevant metadata.  args.msg.msghdr.msg_iov is not set by onload
 * and should not be used.
 *
 * When called, the callback should deal with the received data
 * (stored in onload_zc_recv_args.msg.iov) and can indicate the
 * following by setting flags on its return code:
 *
 * - onload should stop processing this set of messages and return
 * from onload_zc_recv() (rc & ONLOAD_ZC_TERMINATE).  - onload should
 * transfer ownership of the buffer(s) to the application, as the
 * application wishes to keep them for now and will release or reuse
 * them later (rc & ONLOAD_ZC_KEEP).  See onload_zc_release_buffers().
 * Use of ONLOAD_ZC_KEEP with MSG_PEEK is forbidden, due to the
 * ambiguous packet buffer ownership that it implies.
 *
 * The iov passed to the callback may have multiple elements. In this
 * case they are all fragments of the same packet, so when ONLOAD_ZC_KEEP
 * is used the application must pass only the first (iov[0].buf) to
 * onload_zc_release_buffers().
 *
 * As the return code is flags-based the application is free to set
 * any combination of these.  If no flags are set onload will continue
 * to process the next message and ownership of the buffer(s) remains
 * with onload.
 * 
 * The callback can access valid cmsg data (if requested by setting
 * socket options and providing a msg_control buffer in the
 * onload_zc_recv_args) in the onload_zc_recv_args.msghdr structure.
 * 
 * args.flags can take ONLOAD_MSG_DONTWAIT to indicate that the call
 * shouldn't block.
 *
 * For UDP, there are two options for handling data received via the
 * kernel rather than through Onload:
 * 1) Set ONLOAD_MSG_RECV_OS_INLINE in args.flags.  This will result
 * in Onload copying kernel data into oo_zc_bufs and delivering it to
 * the callback as if it had been received via Onload.
 * 2) Do not set ONLOAD_MSG_RECV_OS_INLINE in args.flags.  This will
 * result in Onload return -ENOTEMPTY from the call to
 * onload_zc_recv() if kernel traffic is present.  The caller can then
 * use onload_recvmsg_kernel() to access the kernel traffic.
 *
 * TCP urgent data is not supported by this API. Applications using
 * protocols which may include urgent data should use standard recv
 * calls.
 *
 * The callbacks are called in the same context that invoked
 * onload_zc_recv().
 * 
 * The callback's flags field will be set to ONLOAD_ZC_MSG_SHARED if
 * the msg is shared with other sockets and the caller should take
 * care not to modify the contents of the iovec.
 *
 * Timeouts are handled by setting the socket SO_RCVTIMEO value.
 * 
 * Returns 0 success or <0 to indicate an error.
 *
 * This function can only be used with accelerated sockets (those
 * being handled by Onload).  If a socket has been handed over to the

 * onload_template_handle pointer is updated to contain the (opaque)
 * handle used to refer to this template in subsequent operations.
 *
 * onload_msg_template_update takes an array of
 * onload_template_msg_update_iovec to describe changes to the base
 * packet given in onload_msg_template_alloc.  Each of the update
 * iovec should describe a single change, and contain:
 *
 *  - otmu_base set to the start of the new data.

 *  - otmu_len set to the length of the update.
 *
 *  - otmu_offset set to the offset within the template to update
 *
 * ulen is the length of the updates array (i.e. the number of changes)
 *
 * Currently, the only supported operations with

 * or to send by using ONLOAD_TEMPLATE_FLAGS_SEND_NOW flag.

 * passes to Onload.
 *
 * Templated sends will still respect the TCP state machinery and do a
 * normal send if the state machinery does not allow it (e.g. the send
 * queue is not empty).  In such scenarios, it is possible that the
 * converted normal send can block.  ONLOAD_TEMPLATE_FLAGS_DONTWAIT
 * flag provides the same behavior as MSG_DONTWAIT in such scenarios.
 *
 * By default, if PIO allocation fails, then
 * onload_msg_template_alloc() will fail.  Setting
 * ONLOAD_TEMPLATE_FLAGS_PIO_RETRY will cause it to continue without a
 * PIO AND trying to allocate the PIO in later calls to
 * onload_msg_template_update().
 *
 * onload_msg_template_update can be called multiple times and updates
 * are cumulative.
 *
 * onload_msg_template_abort can be used to abort a templated send
 * without sending.
 * 
 * All functions return zero on success, or <0 to indicate an error.
 *
 * If the associated socket with allocated templates is shutdown or
 * closed, then the allocated templates are freed.  Subsequent calls
 * to access them will return an error.
 *
 * Currently, when the NIC is reset, any socket with some allocated
 * templated sends will get marked as not being able to do any further
 * templated sends.  This is a limitation of the current
 * implementation and will be removed in future.
 *
 * This implementation has known functional and performance
 * limitations that will be resolved in future releases.
 *
 * These functions can only be used with accelerated sockets (those
 * being handled by Onload).  If a socket has been handed over to the
 * kernel stack (e.g. because it has been bound to an address that is
 * not routed over a SFC interface) it will return -ESOCKTNOSUPPORT
